2. Manage Cart
Add/Remove Items: Users can effortlessly add items (both pastries and namkeen) to their cart and remove them as needed.
Real-Time Updates: Cart updates are handled in real-time using Firebase Firestore, so changes are instantly reflected across devices.
Cart Management: The cart interface displays current items, quantities, and the total price, providing a smooth shopping experience.
3. User Authentication
Login/Logout: Users can create an account, log in, and log out securely.
Account Management: Firebase Authentication is used to manage user sessions and credentials, ensuring a secure and user-friendly authentication process.
Personalized Experience: Logged-in users can access personalized features and track their order history.
4. Firebase Integration
Data Storage: All product data, including pastries and namkeen, as well as customer reviews, are stored in Firebase Firestore.
Review System: Users can submit reviews for products, which are then displayed alongside product details.
Backend Services: Firebase handles data storage, real-time updates, and authentication, allowing for a scalable and reliable application.
